\section{Summary of changes with respect to previous AN versions}
\label{sec:changes}

\subsection{Changes with respect to Version 1}

\begin{itemize}
\item Update Figure 2 to remove the cuts on HT, the number of AK8 jets, and number of photons and add the cut on isolated tracks.
\item Add text to describe the treatment for the cases where the scale factor depends on \MET   
\item Update the scale-factors and the kappas
\item Appropriately order the figures and make sure they are in the right sections
\item Add Pie charts for background composition
\item Make an appendix to describe TTJets Closure
\item Revised the background estimation procedure text to be clearer on the use of validation regions
\item Update signal efficiency plots as a function of bb-discriminator working point (Figure 11)
\item Update the Single-lepton Scale factors removing the $\Delta\phi$ cut
\item Include distributions for the double-B discriminant for the leading and subleading jets in Figure 8.
\item Show event efficiencies with three (not just one) different curves / gluino masses in Figure 11.
\item Use gen pt and not reco pt for binned variable in Figure 10 of Higgs tagging efficiency.
\item Add (gen) subleading pt and dr plots for Higgs and Z dr to Figure 2.
\item Figure 12 shows the effect of loosening the mass window
\item Add Appendix D for signal contamination, and add description on how it is handled in the fit in the results section
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Changes with respect to Version 5}

\begin{itemize}
\item Add tagging efficiency for mass only cut to Figure 10.
\end{itemize}
