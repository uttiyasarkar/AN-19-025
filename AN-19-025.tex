% >> Abstract
% Abstract processing:
% 1. **DO NOT use \include or \input** to include the abstract: our abstract extractor will not search through other files than this one.
% 2. **DO NOT use %**                  to comment out sections of the abstract: the extractor will still grab those lines (and they won't be comments any longer!).
% 3. For PASs: **DO NOT use CMS tex macros.**...in the abstract: CDS MathJax processor used on the abstract doesn't understand them _and_ will only look within $$. The abstracts for papers are hand formatted so macros are okay.
\abstract{
   A search for supersymmetry is presented with bosons and large missing transverse momentum in proton-proton collisions collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC at $\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV. We target Higgs bosons produced with large momentum, where the hadronization byproducts of a pair of b-quarks can be reconstructed in a single jet. The analysis makes use of an algorithm to identify jets reconstructed from overlapping $b\overline{b}$. The background from multijet and $t\overline{t}$ events is significanctly reduced with requirements on the heavy flavor tagging of the jet and its mass. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9~fb$^{-1}$ and was collected in 2016.

% >> PDF Metadata
% Do not comment out the following hypersetup lines (metadata). They will disappear in NODRAFT mode and are needed by CDS.
% Also: make sure that the values of the metadata items are sensible and are in plain text with the possible exception of the PDFtitle for a PAS. Then you can use pure TeX symbols as if on a typewriter. Examples: $\sqrt{s}=13\TeV$ => $sqrt{s}=$ 13 TeV; 32\fbinv => 32 fb$^{-1}$
% No unescaped comment % characters.
% No curly braces {} except for TeX in the PDFtitle.
